<!--span is basically a div but for inline text n shit-->
<!-- look into scss and compiler css -->
<!-- jquery 
    jquery selector 
    similar to css uses class names, id's and tag n shit called in a manner such as $('html element').html("shit you want to change it to");

    jquery and event handlers
    example: 
        $('element').on('click',function()
        {
            *some action*
            $(this).html('wow lol') *note that this functions as it does in java which refers to the element that is passed into the first line of jquery
        });
